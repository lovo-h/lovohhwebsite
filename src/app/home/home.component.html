    <p>
      My name is Hector Lovo and I am originally from Harrisonburg, VA.
      I graduated from the University of Virginia with Bachelor of Science
      in Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have professional experience in developing
      <span class="lw-highlight">mobile apps.</span>
      More specifically, I have experience developing iOS apps
      using the programming languages, Objective-C and Swift.
      I also have professional experience in developing
      <span class="lw-highlight">web apps</span>. More specifically,
      I have experience developing web apps using NodeJS, ReactJS/Redux,
      along with other frontend software development tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am working on finishing the development of this website
      <a href="https://www.lovohh.com">lovohh.com</a> so that
      I can showcase other web apps that I have worked on or am
      currently working on. This website was built using Angular2+
      for the frontend and GoLang for the backend.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently looking for a web developer position so
      that I can continue to improve my web app development abilities.
